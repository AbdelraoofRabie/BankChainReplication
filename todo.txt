log of sent message should contain a send sequence number n, indicating that it is for the n'th message sent by this process.

log of sent message should contain a receive sequence number n, indicating that it is for the n'th message received by this process.  
(send and receive sequence numbers are useful for choosing server lifetimes that correspond to interesting failure scenarios.)

description of the tested scenario (including when failures occur), and (if appropriate) the specific aspect of the
program targeted by this scenario 

the name of the configuration file used to run this testcase

other information (if any) needed to run the testcase

the expected outcome (passed or failed, with a brief explanation of the problem if it failed).

testcases should be cumulative; in other words, later submissions should include the testcases from previous
submissions.

PHASE 4: TRANSFERS

-- update pseudocode from phase 1.

  transfer(reqID, accountNum, amount, destBank, destAccount): 
  if a transaction with this reqID has not already been processed, and the
  account balance is at least the transfer amount, 
  then transfer the requested amount of funds from the specified account in this bank to
  destAccount in destBank, and return <reqID, Processed, balance>.
  
  if a transfer with this reqID has not already been processed, and the account
  balance is less than the transfer amount, return <reqID, InsufficientFunds, balance>. 
  
  If exactly the same transaction has already been processed, re-send the same reply. 
  
  If a different transaction with the same reqID has been processed, return <reqID, InconsistentWithHistory, 
  balance>.
  
  It is acceptable for a server of either the source bank or the destination bank to send a
  reply to the client.
